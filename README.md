# 🗂️ C++ DataStructures

## Overview 🌐
This repository contains implementations of popular data structures in C++. It aims to provide an indepth knowledge of basic data structures.

## Features 🎯
- **Variety of Data Structures**: Implementations include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees (binary search trees and AVL trees), graphs (adjacency list and matrix), heaps, hash tables, etc.
- **Well-documented Code**: Each implementation includes comments explaining how the code works.
- **Driver Program**: Includes example usage in the main functions to demonstrate how to use each data structure.

## Contributing 💪

Contributions are welcome! If you have an idea or want to add another data structure:
